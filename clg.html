</head><h1><i>Zamorin's Guruvayurappan College</i></h1></head>
<body><P>The original institution was founded by the Zamorin of Eranad, HH Shri. Manavikraman Maharaja Bahadur, as an English school in June 1877, to impart English education to the young members of the Zamorin's family. In 1878, it came to be known as "Kerala Vidyasala" and was thrown open to Hindu boys of all castes.

    In 1879, the institution was affiliated to the University of Madras as a second grade college. In 1900, the institution was renamed "The Zamorin's College". <br>In 1904, the Zamorin constituted a Board of Management for the administration of the college. The present site of the college at Pokkunnu was purchased with the help of a grant from the Guruvayur Devaswom.
    
    In recognition of this gift, the institution was renamed <u><b>"The Guruvayurappan College"</u></b>. <br>In 1955, the college moved to its present site, at Pokkunnu. In 1958, the college was affiliated to the University of Travancore, which later came to be known as the University of Kerala. Later in 1968, when the University of Calicut was formed, the college was affiliated to it.
    
    The college acquired its present name "The Zamorin's Guruvayurappan College" in 1981.</P>
